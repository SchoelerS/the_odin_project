  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Toss eggplant with salt and place in a colander set over a bowl. Let
      sit, about 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry.</li>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
      celery; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add onion
      and garlic; cook and stir until onion is soft and lightly golden, about 5
      minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl using a slotted spoon.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet. Add eggplant and
      cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in celery mixture, tomatoes, olives, capers, tomato paste, and
      oregano. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until
      caponata is thickened, about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Season caponata with vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Transfer to
      a serving bowl and garnish with parsley.</li>
